*Full write-up coming soon.*

One of the real problems with AI-assisted development: every session starts cold. You spend the first 10 minutes re-establishing context before you can do real work.

This session covers the infrastructure built to solve that:
- OpenBrain for persistent semantic memory across sessions
- MEMORY.md auto-memory system for project and user context
- Session wrap scripts that log labtime, commit open work, and update CURRENT_STATE.md
- Claude Code hooks for automatic session start/stop rituals
